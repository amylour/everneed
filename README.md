# everneed

## Introduction

Everneed is an e-commerce site selling practical, sustainable, earth-friendly products with a carbon-footprint total for your order. It has been developed as my Portfolio Project 5 for the Code Institute's Full Stack Software Developer Course using Django, HTML, CSS, JS & Python.

Everneed has been created using carbon data from available product carbon footprints, or [PCFs](https://tinyurl.com/2htnyr9w). As this data is relatively new, this website is to be viewed with the understanding that the data within is unvalidated, 'fictional' data, calculated to the best of my abilities from all available information on the internet. It's purpose is to purely aid in developing the website's concept.

With the growing threat of climate change and sudden mass displacement of large communities from natural disasters, there has never been a more important time, in recent years, to have a 'Go-Bag' ready for yourself and family members. The initial concept of this website was to introduce the idea of living with a minimum of necessary items, in an attempt to escape capitalism and free ourselves to be able to experience life and spend time with our loved ones. This concept could be a more grim, mandatory idea in the not-too-distant future, if all manufacturing of unnecessary goods were to cease in an sudden effort to meet a new global carbon emmissions target, since we have already shot through the [existing ones](https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2022#:~:text=The%20world%20is%20not%20on,cent%20to%20avoid%20global%20catastrophe.).

Choosing to only purchase 100% necessary items, that have been created in the most sustainable way, and to be aware of your carbon spending at the same time, could be an e-commerce store type that will be with us sooner than we think. [Carbon credits](https://carboncredits.com/carbon-credits-explained-2023-guide/) are already being implemented in industrial and agricultural sectors in an effort to slow our global carbon emissions rate, it could, in the near future, start affecting our purchases as individuals.
