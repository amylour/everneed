## Bugs

- JavaScript dropdown menu fix, movig the mouseleave function outside of the main code seems to fix the 'dropdown menu randomly not appearing on hover' issue. Commit -> No.e27b7a5 This did not fix it, 2nd fix was to update to Bootstrap 4.6 and add 'ease' to menu hover transitions. Currently working consistently. Commit -> No. 2aab065
